OSX Cursor Hack
===============

See [this tweet for a quick demo](https://twitter.com/possan/status/650705923850280961).

You need to first build it add the .app bundle to the list of applicatios that are allowed to access the accessibility features in OSX. (in System Preferences / Security and Privacy / Privacy / Accessibility) - After that, it should start and actually change the size of your mouse cursor. I've only tested this in OSX El Capitan.
